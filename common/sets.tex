\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{set} is an object made up of objects. It can also be referred to as a
  \textbf{class}, \textbf{collection}, or \textbf{family} of objects. If $S$ is a set
  and $x$ is an object in $S$, we may say that $x$ is a \textbf{member of} $S$, an
  \textbf{element of} $S$, that $x$ \textbf{belongs to} $S$, or just that $x$ is
  \textbf{in} $S$. If $x$ is in $S$, this can be represented by $x \in S$, or by $S
  \ni x$.

  $S$ may be finite or infinite. If $S$ is finite, it can be described by displaying
  its members inside braces:
  \begin{align*}
    S = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{exm}
  The set $S$ of positive integers from $1$ to $5$ would be
  \begin{align*}
    S = \{1,2,3,4,5\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{exm}

\begin{defn}
  If $S$ and $T$ are sets, $S$ is called a \textbf{subset of} $T$, or said to be
  \textbf{contained in} $T$, if each member of $S$ is also a member of $T$. Any set
  is a subset of itself. If $S$ is a subset of $T$ and $T$ differs from $S$, $S$ is
  then called a \textbf{proper subset} of $T$. In other words, $S$ is a proper subset
  of $T$ if $S$ is contained in $T$ but $T$ is not contained in $S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exm}
  If
  \begin{align*}
    S &= \{1,2,3,4,5\}\\
    \shortintertext{and}
    T &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5\},
  \end{align*}
  then $S$ is a subset of $T$.
\end{exm}

\begin{defn}
  If $S$ and $T$ are sets, the \textbf{union of $S$ and $T$} is the set $S \cup T$,
  which contains all objects $x$ that are members of either $S$ or $T$.

  \begin{exm}
    If
    \begin{align*}
      S &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\\
      \shortintertext{and}
      T &= \{-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0\},
    \end{align*}
    then
    \begin{align*}
      S \cup T &= \{-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5\}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{exm}

  If $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ are sets, their \textbf{union} is the set $\bigcup_{j =
  1}^{n}S_j$, which consists of all $x$ which are members of at least one of
  $S_1,\ldots,S_n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{comm}
  If $x$ is said to be either in $S$ or in $T$, this does not exclude the possibility
  that $x$ is in both.
\end{comm}

\begin{defn}
  If $S$ and $T$ are sets, the \textbf{intersection of $S$ and $T$} is the set $S
  \cap T$, which contains all objects $x$ that are members of both $S$ and $T$.

  \begin{exm}
    If
    \begin{align*}
      S &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\\
      \shortintertext{and}
      T &= \{-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0\},
    \end{align*}
    then
    \begin{align*}
      S \cap T &= \{0\}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{exm}

  If $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ are sets, their \textbf{intersection} is the set $\bigcap_{j =
  1}^{n}S_j$, which consists of all $x$ which are members of each of
  $S_1,\ldots,S_n$.
\end{defn}
