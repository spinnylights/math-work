# Zoe's math work repo

Here I keep text and images I've produced in the course of
studying math: definitions and other notes, proofs I've worked
out, and my solutions to problem sets. The main purpose of this
repo is to keep me motivated and accountable: I know people are
eager to see _Crypt Underworld_ finished and I don't want anyone
to think I'm slacking off if they don't see work going on [over
there](https://github.com/spinnylights/crypt_underworld). I need
a broader math background than I started out on this project with
for the graphics programming etc. so some of my time has to be
devoted to math studies.

Of course, this repo might also be handy for someone as a quick
reference. These documents are much terser than a proper
textbook, but if you already know the material and just want to
quickly look something up you might find the information you need
here.
